- The `Logic Output Channel` is the channel that will be produced when the condition is met. It's value will be 1 when true, 0 when false.
 - The `On Logic True Output Event` is produced when the condition becomes true.
 - The `On Logic False Output Event` is produced when the condition becomes false.
 - The `Logic On Delay` is the time in milliseconds that the logic output will be delayed after the condition is met.
 - The `Logic Off Delay` is the time in milliseconds that the logic output will be delayed after the condition is no longer met.
