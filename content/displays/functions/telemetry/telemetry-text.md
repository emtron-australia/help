## Quick Start

### Setup: ED7/ED10

Assuming you have an active text chat license and the [authentication settings](telemetry#authentication) configured in Display Studio, you can now configure the text chat function.

#### Settings

Text chat settings can be accessed from the main menu: `Functions → Text Chat`.

| Setting                    | Description                                                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Once configured, 'Write' the config.

#### Channels

The following channels are available to monitor the status of the system.

#### Events

### Setup: EmStream

EmStream stores authentication information per service type rather than in one place for flexibility.

The data service settings can be found in `File → Text Chat Settings`.

| Setting      | Description                                                                      |

Once entered, select `Connect` to connect to the text server. Once connected you will see `Chat Connected` in the top right hand corner.

If connection fails, the reason will be shown in the `Text Chat Settings` popup.

Once connected, you can open the **Chat Console* by either clicking the icon in the top right hand corner or from the menu `View → Show Chat Console`.

### Setup: Web Interface (Browser)

### Quick Messages

You can send messages to the chat room based on events occurring.

| Setting              | Description                                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Event                | When this event occurs, the message will be sent              |
| Message              | The text at the start of the automated messages.              |
| Append Channel Value | The a channel's value to append to the messages when sending. |

e.g. Set event to `Engine Start`, message to `Engine Started, fuel level`, and append channel to `Fuel Level`.
When the vehicle starts, all connected chat clients will see a message saying the engine has started with the current fuel level.


### Message Triggers

You can respond to certain patterns being received. When they are received you can publish a system event.

 | Setting       | Description                                                     |

 | Pattern       | The pattern you want, e.g. "#next-screen".                      |
 | Trigger Event | The event you want to publish in the system. e.g. "Next Screen" |

With the above examples, you could change the screen on the Emtron display by sending #next-screen in a connected chat client.
