## Activation

To activate the Telemetry feature on your device, login to the [Emtron License Server](https://license.emtronaustralia.com.au).
Once logged in, from your Dashboard, click the `Activate Telemetry` button.

 * Enter the device serial number.
 * Enter the one time user Telemetry Activation code as provided after purchase.
 * Enter the *Telemetry Vehicle Name*.  This will be used in the telemetry authentication settings.
 * Enter the *Telemetry Password*.  This will be used in the telemetry authentication settings. Use a password you are comfortable sharing with team members as it is used by all software connecting to the vehicle.

Once the details have been filled out, click `Activate Now` to complete the process.
