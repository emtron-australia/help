## Shift Calculation

The shift calculation writes to the `Shift Indication` channel. The value progresses from 1 to 99, then 100 when the 100% value is met or exceeded.
If you don’t want to use the shift calculation, set the input channel to ‘None’.

## Shift Pattern

The shift patterns are selected based on the input channel value. The pattern with the nearest value equal to or less than the input channel value is displayed.


> TIP: Drag the LEDs to copy the colours around
