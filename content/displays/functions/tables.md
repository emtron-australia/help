Tables work the very similar to how ECU tables work. They have an x and y axis where [channels](../concepts/channels-and-events#channels) are assigned as inputs. The corresponding table value is looked up then output to the assigned channel.

Values are interpolate between cells providing a smooth output.

There is no limit on the number of tables you can create.
