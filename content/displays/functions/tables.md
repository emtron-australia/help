Tables function similarly to ECU tables, featuring an X and Y axis where [channels](../concepts/channels-and-events#channels) are assigned as inputs.

The system looks up the corresponding table value and outputs it to the assigned channel. Values are interpolated between cells to ensure a smooth output.

There is no limit to the number of tables you can create.
