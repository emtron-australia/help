Injector timing units are values in degrees.

Units are described as an "Advance Table", so values are BTDC.

IE - 400 degrees = 400 degrees before TDC Cylinder 1 compression,&nbsp;

or also 40 degrees before TDC between exhaust and intake stroke (overlap) - Valves Closed&nbsp;

&#51;60 degrees = TDC between exhaust and intake stroke (overlap period)

&#51;00 degrees = 60 degrees after intake valve has opened&nbsp;


SOI/EOI (Determines start of injection or end of injection) function is controlled under : [Injection Timing](<InjectionTiming.md>)
