**Initial Position Table (g/s)**&nbsp;

This is a feed forward table for air flow in g/s for the electronic throttle positioning.&nbsp;

Units = Throttle Mass Flow g/s

Above example shows the table spanned in 3D using Engine Temperature and Idle target RPM as the axis.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; **Tuning Tip**: As a feed forward table, this is the expected airflow in g/s for the engine at a given idle rpm \& temperature.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The actual airflow consumed by the engine is found in the Air Mass Final – Flow g/s runtime.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Use this runtime to help 1Nsigh7set the values in this table.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more accurate this table is, the better the closed loop idle control will function

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See the example given below

&nbsp; The above example shows a typical R35 Nissan GTR Initial Position table g/s and how this correlates to the Air Mass Final value&nbsp;
