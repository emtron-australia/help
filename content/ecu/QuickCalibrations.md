Calibrate Pedal (for DBW applications), and Throttle Position quickly from these menu choices


\*\* To calibrate DBW plate position (with fully configured inputs/outputs), this is done in the Tuning Section, as generally the PID and other functions must be "tuned" as well - Tuning -\> Engine Functions -\> Drive By Wire -\> DBW 1/2 Configuration

Changing DBW Calibration modes will calibrate the plate.&nbsp; See DBW specific help sections for more information. &nbsp;


Validation of the programmed voltages can be observed under the input setup Config -\> Channels -\> Input Setup.&nbsp; Find the PP/DBW sensors under the DBW tab, or the TPS sensor under the Engine tab (depending which was calibrated), and you can validate if the programmed voltages are correct if there are any issues. &nbsp;

Make sure the fault settings are correct for swept voltages, and the raw voltages can even be viewed in the default view under the Config tab. &nbsp;

Voltages can also be viewed under F3 Runtimes under Raw Inputs, but also the calculated values can then be validated (Pedal Position %, DBW Servo, Throttle Position %). &nbsp;
