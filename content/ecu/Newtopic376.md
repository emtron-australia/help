Initial position is the feed forward for Boost Valve Position %, and the closed loop PID if CL is active. &nbsp;



\*\*Note

Boost Valve Deadtime is pre-calculated and added to Initial Position. &nbsp;


\*\*Note â€“ Push/Pull Solenoid Control

Will require no/very little initial position&nbsp;
