**Boost Solenoid Ddeadtime Table (ms)**

\

This look up table defines the deadtime of the Boost Solenoid. &nbsp;

The deadtime of the solenoid is crucial where control of the boost solenoid duty cycle is especially crucial – IE applications using Push-Pull solenoids or 4-port solenoid control. &nbsp;


\*\*Note – Deadtime will automatically add Boost Valve Position %


\*\* Tuning tip –&nbsp;

A good way to set solenoid deadtime is to do it on a bench and monitor leakage through the valve.&nbsp; Increase deadtime until the brink of leakage, and deadtime is correct. &nbsp;
