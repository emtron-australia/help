The Injector Driver Setup is where the injector driver output is configured. &nbsp;

For High Impedance or Saturated injectors the Saturated setting should be used


KV based ECU's also have the ability for user defined Peak and Hold setting.

Peak \& Hold refers to low impedance injectors that require significantly more current to run correctly


Peak and Hold Examples:


Peak Current = 4A

Peak/Hold Ratio = 4. This gives 4A/4 = 1A Hold Current


Peak Current = 6A

Peak/Hold Ratio = 6. This gives 6A/6 = 1A Hold Current


Peak Current = 6A

Peak/Hold Ratio = 1.5. This gives 6A/1.5 = 4A Hold Current


The Custom setting allows for individual injector channel setup
