**Proportional Gain Table**

\

Proportional gain controls how aggressive instantaneous correction must be.

This parameter can be expanded into a 3D look up table to provide greater accuracy regarding closed loop control.  


P is Gain \* 0.01 \* Idle target Error to convert to g/s added – follows the control frequency
