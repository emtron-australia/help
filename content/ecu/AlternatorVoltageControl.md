Different Alternators require different control strategies:


**&#49;) Duty Cycle vs Output Voltage.**


The ECU controls the energizing current of the field coil by sending duty signals to the power transistor (D Terminal) incorporated in the alternator. In duty signal control, energizing current is determined by changing the energized time ratio of the power transistor within a cycle of the specified frequency i.e. the higher the duty cycle the higher the output voltage.
