**Traction Control**


The following calculated runtimes are generated by Emtron that are Traction Control related (to be further discussed more specifically):&nbsp;


&nbsp; &nbsp; Traction Status &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; The working status of the traction control&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Traction Control State&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; The working state of the traction control

&nbsp; &nbsp; Ign Traction Trim &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Ignition advance compensation&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Traction Target &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; %Slip Target when Traction Control is active

&nbsp; &nbsp; Traction Feedforward &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; % feed forward when Traction Control is active

&nbsp; &nbsp; Traction Target Error &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; The total drive slip percentage above/below the Traction Target&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Traction PID &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Proportional, Integral, and Derivative gains&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Traction Limit Request &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Status of Traction Control being utilized in real-time

&nbsp; &nbsp; Traction Target Table &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Active traction target table&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Drive Slip Calculation &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Percentage of slip between defined speed channels

&nbsp; &nbsp; Outputshaft Slip&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; Percentage of slip between Outputshaft speed source and Ideal

&nbsp; &nbsp; Outputshaft Ideal Speed&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; Outputshaft Ideal Speed as defined by look up table

&nbsp; &nbsp; Traction RPM Target&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; Outputshaft Source calculates Engine Speed


\*\* All these runtimes can be utilized within other functions of Emtron. &nbsp;

\*\* Traction Target Error for example can offset torque management functions (DBW target, Pedal Demand clamps, etc)&nbsp;

&#48;% = Requested cut all Ignition (no Fuel)

&#49;00% = Requested cut all Fuel (no Ign)


\*\* Example: Ratio = 80%

Fuel Cut = 80% of requested Cut

Ign Cut = 20% of requested Cut

Example: Output Shaft Speed = 2000 RPM

Clutch Slip = 21% &nbsp; &nbsp;

Gear Ratio = 2.056

Traction Slip Target = 8%

Traction RPM Target = 2000 x 2.056 x 1.21&nbsp; x 1.08 = 5373 RPM


**Traction Control Lockouts**


**RPM Lo Lockout**


Traction Control will be OFF below this Engine Speed.&nbsp;


Typical : 1500 RPM&nbsp;


&#48; = OFF


**RPM Hi Loclout**


Traction Control will be OFF above&nbsp; this Engine Speed.&nbsp;


Typical :&nbsp; 200 RPM below RPM limit


&#48; = OFF


**TP Lo Lockout**


Traction Control will be OFF below this Throttle setting.&nbsp;


Typical : 5.0 %


&#48; = OFF


**TP Hi Lockout**


Traction Control will be OFF above this Throttle setting.&nbsp;


&#48; = OFF


**%Slip Lo Lockout**


Traction Control will be OFF below this %Slip.&nbsp;


Typical : 5.0 %


**User Lockout**


Create a custom lockout using a User Channel.


When the channel is ON the lockout is active


**Traction Table Control**


Selects the active Table Control method of the Traction Control


&#48;: Tables OFF

&#49;: ON - Table 1

&#50;: ON - Table 2

&#51;: ON - Table 3

&#52;: Not Available

&#53;: ON - Cal Slot

&#54;: ON - Z-Axis


**Traction Target Tables**


These look up table define the amount of %Slip to be maintained by the ECU. Slip below the value will generate a *positive* Traction Target Error, while slip above the value will generate a *negative* Traction Target Error.&nbsp; Slip above the value triggers the ECU to cut engine torque by use of fuel/ignition cuts, timing retard, or other connected functions. &nbsp;


See the following examples:

A simple fixed value for traction control to become active

Traction Target vs Front Axle Speed

&nbsp; &nbsp; \*\* Rear axle as Drive Speed


![Image](</img/NewItem243.png>)

A more comprehensive table utilizing internal G-Force sensor (Lateral Accel)

&nbsp; &nbsp; \*\* Rear axle as Drive Speed


\*\* G-Force sensor must be pre-configured


**Traction Slip Offset Tables**


Like any other “offset” table in Emtune, these tables add to the main target tables.&nbsp; Tables can be configured to use any runtime, and spanned in 3D.&nbsp;


See the following example:


![Image](</img/NewItem242.png>)

A more comprehensive use of the offset table utilizing KV series Internal G-Force sensor (Verticle Force), and a Rotary Position Switch to change the final Slip Target. &nbsp;


\*\* G-Force sensor must be pre-configured

\*\* Rotary Position Switch must be pre-configured


**Ignition Retard Tables**


Amount of ignition retard the traction system can employ once the system is active.&nbsp; Tables can be configured to use any runtime, and spanned in 3D to enhance flexibility.&nbsp;


See the following example:


![Image](</img/NewItem241.png>)

&nbsp;&nbsp;


\*\* Gear Recognition must be pre-configured

\*\* Retard is being applied here only when the Traction Target Error is *negative*, meaning the %slip is above the Traction Target. &nbsp;


**Traction PID setup**


**Traction Deadband +/-**


The output control signal is held constant when the Input Signal (DriveSlip) falls within the deadband range of the Setpoint (Slip Target). This helps reduce steady state error and oscillations.


Typical: 0.20 %


**Integral Positive Clamp**


Used to clamp the contribution of the integral term in the PID loop and prevent Integal Windup.


Typical Value: 20.0 %


**Integral Negative Clamp**


Used to clamp the contribution of the integral term in the PID loop and prevent Integal Windup.


Typical Value: - 20.0 %


**Slip Target Filter**


Filters the Target signal to help smooth out any pulsations


Typcial Value: 6 ( 0 = OFF)


Range: 0 - 10


**Feed Forward %Cut Table**


Emtron uses a Feedforward Table for a base %Cut for the PID function to operate from. &nbsp; &nbsp;


This allows for very fast response as the ECU has a basic lookup table for %Cut to function from before the PID is applied. &nbsp;


See the following example:


![Image](</img/NewItem240.png>)

A more comprehensive use of the Feed Forward %Cut table utilizing the Traction Target Error calculation and gear recognition. &nbsp;


\*\* Gear Recognition must be pre-configured


**Proportional Gain Table**


Proportional gain controls how aggressive instantaneous correction must be vs Target Error.&nbsp;

This parameter can be expanded into a 3D look up table to provide greater accuracy regarding closed loop control.&nbsp; &nbsp;


**Integral Gain Table**


Integral gain controls how much adaptive correction is needed.

This parameter can be expanded into a 3D look up table to provide greater accuracy regarding closed loop control.&nbsp; &nbsp;


**Derivative Gain Table**


Derivative gain controls predictive correction.&nbsp; This function is used to prevent overshooting targets by looking at a number of factors like rate of change, and P and I gain.&nbsp;

This parameter can be expanded into a 3D look up table to provide greater accuracy regarding closed loop control.&nbsp; &nbsp;


**Traction Max Cut Table (% Cut)**


This clamps the maximum cut the traction control can apply based on the entered values. &nbsp;


See the following example:


![Image](</img/NewItem239.png>)


\*\* Rear Axle Speed must be pre-configured
