**Initial Position Table**

\
This look up table defines the base position of the idle speed control valve.  


If a 2 or 3 wire Idle Solenoid is used, then this a base duty cycle to define position.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Units = % Duty Cycle

If a stepper motor, these are step counts from the closed position.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Units = Step Count

If DBW, this is a feed forward table for the electronic throttle positioning.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; Units = Drive By Wire Servo Position&nbsp;

If DBW TMF, this is a feed forward table for air flow in g/s for the electronic throttle positioning.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Units = Throttle Mass Flow g/s
