Fuel Model: Charge Temp


Includes the Charge Temperature in the Fuel Model Speed Density Calculation.&nbsp; The ECU is then able to automatically adjust the Air Mass (g) based on this temperature.&nbsp;


When selected to ON the Charge Temp Comp table(s) should initially be set to zero


When Selected to OFF the Fuel Model uses a default value of 20.0 DegC and the Charge Temp Comp Table is therefore required to&nbsp; provide Charge Temp Compensations.


Recommended Setting = ON
