**Knock Studio**&nbsp;


The ECU uses a high precision digital filter to detect engine knock. To achieve high accuracy the center frequency and bandwidth of the filter are controlled from this menu.


A Filter Window is a mathematical function that overlays the filter design helping to enhance the filter design. This effect of these different windows can be viewed using this Knock Studio. Testing different windows is recommend to select the option that gives the best signal to noise ratio.&nbsp;


Once the filter design is complete, pressing Ok allows the filter coefficients to be calculated and the Knock Control system is ready to be used.&nbsp;
