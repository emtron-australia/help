**Upshift Torque Reduction Delay**


This is the length of time from when :

&#49;) Upshift&nbsp; solenoid is switch ON&nbsp; (Electronic)&nbsp; OR &nbsp;

&#50;) Force Threshold is exceeded (Mechanical)


to when the Engine Torque Reduction begins with Engine %Cutting and Ignition Retard.


Resolution = 1ms


\*\* For Electronic Paddle Shift, this is used to pre-load the shift
