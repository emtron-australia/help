The Decel Sensitivity Table is the multiplication factor as a percentage of fuel removed, based on the rate of change of the Accel/Decel mode&nbsp;

Note: Must be set to PP or TP


Example:

dTP1 = 10%

Decel Sense = 10%

Fuel base pulse width = 5.0ms

Decel PW = 10\*0.10 = 1.0ms

Total fuel pulse width = 5.0 â€“ 1.0 = 4.0ms&nbsp;
