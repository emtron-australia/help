**Compensations**&nbsp;


All Fuel Compensations (other than **Charge Temperature Estimate** and **Charge Temperature Offset**) are percentage compensations added/subtracted onto Final Fuel Mass calculations :


Fuel Mass Final Uncorrected = 0.0367g

Injector Mass Flow = 309 g/sec

User Comp 1 = +19.5%

 

Fuel Mass Final Corrected = 0.0367 x 1.195 = 0.0438g

 

Effective Pulsewidth Effective = Fuel Mass Final Corrected x  (1/Injector Mass Flow )x 60

Effective Pulsewidth Effective = 0.0438 x 1/309 x 60 = 8.515ms
