The Calculated runtimes Main is where the Efficiency Calculation and Load Calculation runtimes are defined.

The runtime is defined by nominating the air mass calculation and or blend to used to arrive at the runtime result

This permits the user to quickly utilize more complex forms of efficiency \& load calculation

Both the efficiency \& load calculation runtimes are labeled with a specific task in mind and also available as a selectable runtime for any table


Example:&nbsp;

In the KV sample file; note the main VE table load axis (Y axis) is configured as “Efficiency Calculation”, and the main ignition map is configured as “Load Calculation”
