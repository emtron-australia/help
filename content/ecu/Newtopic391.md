**Upshift Rev-Match Enable Table**


This table controls when the Rev-Match function is started.


&#48; = OFF

&#49;00 = ON&nbsp;

Any other value = no change


It is important the Rev-match RPM limiting starts AFTER the initial Torque Reduction Cut/Retard. This is because the Upshift Rev-Match RPM limit will be lower than the current&nbsp; Engine Speed and will most likely take %cut priority,&nbsp; preventing the initial Torque Reduction Cut/Retard from working as expected.
