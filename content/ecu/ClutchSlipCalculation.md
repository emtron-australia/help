title: "Clutch Slip Calculation"
---

Clutch Slip Calculation uses 2 Inputs:


&#49;) Engine Speed (RPM)

&#50;) Input Shaft Speed (RPM)


Example.


Engine Speed = 6000

Input Shaft Speed = 5756 RPM


Clutch Slip(%) = &nbsp; Input Shaft Speed - Engine Speed

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Engine Speed


Clutch Slip(%) =&nbsp; -4.06 %&nbsp;


This means the Input Shaft is rotating 4.06% slower than the Engine Speed... i.e 4.06% Clutch Slip.
