Scope Voltage Clipping


The scope can only read +/- 25v.&nbsp; Anything over 25v (regardless of input specifications) will display signals that can be misconstrued as error. &nbsp;

Above is an example of the scope “clipping” over its 25v limit.&nbsp;

This is normal and should not be considered an error in signal. &nbsp;


\*\* If signals need to be measured reliably +/- 25v, then an external scope tool must be used. &nbsp;
