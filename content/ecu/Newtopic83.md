**Knock Threshold Table**


This table defines the permissible maximum measured Knock Level&nbsp;

That is, in the logger, the knock threshold is the value (or line) that once crossed is considered knock.

If this table is set too high, knock will not be detected.

Both the X \& The Y-Axis can spanned across any runtime or disabled

Engine Torque (Uncorrected) \& Engine RPM are commonly used (See example below)

This table is user defined and must be validated by the tuner.&nbsp;
