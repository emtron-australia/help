**Proportional Gain**


Proportional gain controls how aggressive instantaneous correction must be.&nbsp;


**Integral Gain Table**


Integral gain controls how much adaptive correction is needed.


**Derivative Gain Table**


Derivative gain controls predictive correction.&nbsp; This function is used to prevent overshooting targets by looking at a number of factors like rate of change, and P and I gain.&nbsp;


Commonly the I gain is not used and this allows the control oscillate over and below the Base Ignition Timing value. &nbsp;

This can be important when operating the system in conjunction with an Idle Control valve so the valve position required can remain close to itâ€™s Feed Forward value. &nbsp;
