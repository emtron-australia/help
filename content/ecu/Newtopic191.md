Pre-Crank Multi Pulse Count


On Ethanol base fuels significantly more pre-crank is required to&nbsp;

start the engine.&nbsp; However long pre-crank pulses can cause the&nbsp;

fuel to enter a liquid state, normally contaminating the spark plugs

and inhibiting good starting .&nbsp;


The solution is a shorter pulse width but more pulses.
