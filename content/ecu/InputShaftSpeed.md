See [Speed Settings](<SpeedSettings1.md>) for information on sensor setup.


**Input Shaft Speed Calculation**&nbsp;


With 0% Clutch Slip, for the Input Shaft RPM to match the Engine Speed the Scaler should be calculated as follows:


Scaler =&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Number teeth on Input Shaft


**Example1**:&nbsp; 4 teeth on the Input Shaft


Scaler = 60 / 4 = 15.00


**Example1:**&nbsp; 7 teeth on the Input Shaft


Scaler = 60 / 7 = 8.57
