**Idle Speed Control**


The following calculated run times are generated by Emtron that are Ide Speed Control related (to be further discussed more specifically):&nbsp;


&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle Target &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Current Target Idle Speed

&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle Position&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Live Idle Position

&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle Target Error &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Error from Target Idle Speed&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle Position Base &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Base Position of Idle Speed (%/Steps)

&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle Position Flow Target&nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Flow Target when using Idle TMF mode (g/second)

&nbsp; &nbsp; Throttle Area - Idle &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Idle Throttle Area % &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Pedal Position 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Pedal Position&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle Target Offsets (grp)&nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Offsets to Idle Target (RPM)

&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle Comps (group) &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Offsets to Idle Position (%/Steps)

&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle Status &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Current status of Idle Speed Control

&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle PID Status&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; Status of Idle Speed Control Closed Loop PID&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle P, I, and D&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; Proportional, Integral, and Derivative live data from Closed Loop&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Idle Feed Forward&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; Feed forward position for Idle Speed Closed Loop Control&nbsp;


**Idle Speed Control Function Setup**


Emtron has eight methods of Idle Speed Control


* Config, Function Setup, Idle Speed Control


&#50; Wire Idle Solenoid

&nbsp; &nbsp; Configure one output for control

&#51; Wire Idle Solenoid

&nbsp; &nbsp; Configure two outputs for control (Main/Slave)

Bipolar Stepper&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Configure four outputs for control

Unipolar Stepper

&nbsp; &nbsp; Configure four outputs for control

DBW 1

&nbsp; &nbsp; No outputs, as the function takes over DBW positioning (raw position)

DBW 1+2

&nbsp; &nbsp; No outputs, as the function takes over DBW 1+2 positioning (raw position)

DBW 1 TMF

&nbsp; &nbsp; No outputs, as the function takes over DBW positioning (Throttle Mass Flow target)

DBW 1+2 TMF

&nbsp; &nbsp; No outputs, as the function takes over DBW 1+2 positioning (Throttle Mass Flow target)



\*\* Idle Throttle Mass Flow (TMF) Setup


Use the "Tuning View -\> Engine Functions -\> Throttle Body Model" menu to config the Throttle Mass Flow settings.&nbsp; As TMF uses the pressure before and after the throttle plate, these pressure references in this menu must be setup correctly.&nbsp; See Idle Speed Tuning
