Tuning transient functions in Emtune is done through a combination of function setup and table settings.&nbsp;

&nbsp;The following runtimes are generated which are applied/added/subtracted to final Injection PW. &nbsp;


Accel Fuel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – Added fuel PW (added to final injection PW)

Accel Clamp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – The maximum PW that can be added at that moment

Decel Fuel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – Decreased fuel PW (subtracted from final injection PW)

Decel Clamp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – The maximum PW that can be decreased at that moment&nbsp;

Fuel Acce/Decel Scaler &nbsp; &nbsp; – The amount of PW governed by Engine Temperature Comp multiplier
