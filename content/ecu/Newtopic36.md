**What is a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC)?**

Diagnostic trouble codes (or fault codes) are codes that are stored by the ECU. These are stored in response to a problem when a sensor in the car reports a reading that is outside the normal/accepted range\
\
These DTC's identify a particular problem area and are intended to provide the user with a guide as to where a fault might be occurring within the vehicle. The ECU will always reply with a 'P' code or Powertrain code&nbsp;

## Difference Between Generic \& Manufacturer Specific...

 

| **Code type**                              | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Generic** (normally P0xxx)               | The definition for the code is defined in the EOBD / OBD-II standard and will be the same for all manufacturers.                                                    |
| **Manufacturer-specific** (normally P1xxx) | Where manufacturers feel that a code is not available within the generic list, they can add their own codes. The definitions for these are set by the manufacturer. |


\
In general, codes that begin with P0 are Generic codes, whereas codes that begin with P1 are manufacturer-specific in this case codes generated by Emtron.
