### DBW Deadband +/-

The output control signal is held constant when the Input Signal (Throttle Position) falls within the deadband range of the Target.&nbsp;

This helps reduce steady state error and oscillations.


Typical : 0.2 %TP

### DBW 2 Custom PID

If a second DBW servo is used that is of a different type, then the PID can be customized separately.&nbsp;

This enables configuration tables for DBW 2


\*\* Most commonly used when a DBW servo is used for bypassing air for a turbocharged or supercharged vehicle (DBW Air Bleed)


&#48;: OFF

&#49;: ON


**DBW Target Filter - Time Constant**

Low pass digital filter Time Constant characterizes the speed taken to respond to a step input.&nbsp;

The value entered represents the time (in ms) it takes for the output to reach 63% of the stepped input value.&nbsp;


For example if the step input changed occurred from 0 - 50.0% and the Time Constant was 25ms, the filtered output would reach 31.5% after 25ms.


### Tuning DBW PID


DBW servo position is controlled in the Torque Management section -\> Pedal Demand.
