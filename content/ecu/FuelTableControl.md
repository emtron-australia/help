**Fuel Table Control**


**Tuning -\> Fuel -\> Fuel Table Control**&nbsp;


The fuel table control allows you to tailor the number of fuel tables used and how they are utilized.

There are 3 Main VE tables available, they can be used individually, on a user selectable cal slot

(Example: The position of the Si Drive selector in a Subaru Sti over the CAN BUS)

On a user defined Z-Axis (Example: Spanned across ethanol content)

Or a user defined blend across tables based on specified parameters.

This allows a user defined level of complexity&nbsp;

This level of complexity flexibility is common to all fuel control tables.

**Compensation Tables:**


The compensation tables offer the tuner the ability to compensate for a wide range of variable conditions

All compensation tables are user definable 3D tables that can be utilized against any runtime

More commonly used compensations are already named \& linked to their specific purpose

With 2 additional User Comp tables where all parameters are defined by the user.
