There are 10 ranges which can be set by the user in a 3D table.&nbsp; Each number defines a range.&nbsp;


Each range allows for storage of LTFT values. &nbsp;


This allows the user to define "zones" so that different LTFT learning values do not affect each other, but also allow the trims to be fed forward appropriately &nbsp;


When in this range the LTFT looks at the STFT and loads values for these ranges.&nbsp;


A value of “0” disables the LTFT for that zone


LTFT Range Values can be viewed in Runtimes under Lambda as well
