**Welcome Screen**


When first opening Emtune software a Welcome Screen is displayed. &nbsp;

From here the user has several options in which they would want to use the connection to their PC. &nbsp;

This is one of the unique features to Emtron/Emtune as it eliminates many of the anxieties of connecting to ECU systems. &nbsp;

An end user can easily download an ECU log, or look at one way Live Data communication without actually opening the calibration file. &nbsp;


**Open ECU (only available when ECU is connected)**

Use this option to connect to the ECU to perform configuration, calibration, live PC data logging, scope functions, and more. &nbsp;

This is the main mode for live calibrating. &nbsp;

**Tuning Tip**: *The Hot key to achieve connection / disconnection lieu of using the mouse is F12*



**Live Data (only available when ECU is connected)**

This option allows the user to connect to the ECU in a “one way” communication mode.&nbsp; The mode does not allow transmitting of any user settings that can change the calibration in any way.&nbsp; The live data display dashboards, runtime plots, gauges, pages, tabs, and more must be configured in the Open ECU/Open File modes.&nbsp; Generally this is performed by the dealer/installer/calibrator of the ECU as depending on the application the display changes may change.&nbsp; All runtime data is also available in the Live Data mode as well. &nbsp;

**Open File (available anytime the software is opened)**

This mode allows offline calibration editing, as well as configuration of the Live Data page.


**Send File to ECU (only available when ECU is connected)**

![Image](</lib/NewItem154.png>)


A previously saved calibration file (either from live calibrating, or offline editing) can be sent and stored to the ECU with this option.&nbsp; This allows the user to update the calibration file without having to open the ECU. &nbsp;


**Update Firmware (only available when ECU is connected)**


![Image](</lib/NewItem153.png>)


Use this function to update the ECU Firmware.&nbsp; **USE CAUTION.**&nbsp; This procedure should only be done by authorized dealers unless under strict instruction to do so otherwise.&nbsp; The ECU should have a stable power source during updating as it takes up to 25 min to complete. &nbsp;


**Download ECU Log (only available when ECU is connected)**


![Image](</lib/NewItem152.png>)


This function downloads the ECU log.&nbsp; The ECU logging function is configured in the Open ECU/Open File mode inside the calibration file. &nbsp;
