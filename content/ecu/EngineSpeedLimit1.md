**Engine Speed Limits/Cuts**


The following calculated runtimes are generated by Emtron that are Engine Speed Limit/Cut related (to be further discussed more specifically):&nbsp;

\*\* Highest priority Fcut and Highest priority Icut Runtimes will always show the active limit request.&nbsp; It is highly recommended to always have these channels in the ECU logger. &nbsp;


The Limit with the highest percentage cut ALWAYS get priority over other pending limits. This also means any Ignition or Fuel adjustments associated with the function also get priority.


So ONLY 1 limit can be active at any one time.


Functions that can limit the engine are:


* Engine Speed Limit 1
* Engine Speed Limit 2
* Engine Speed Limit 3
* MAP Limit 1
* MAP Limit 1
* Ground Speed Limit 1
* Ground Speed Limit 2
* Launch Limit
* Gear Cut&nbsp;
* Traction Control Limit
* Anti-Lag Cut
* Anti-Lag cool down&nbsp;
* DBW Safety Limit
* Limp Home Limit 1
* Limp Home Limit 2



Example. RPM limit is currently active.


RPM LImit 1 = 60% Cut

RPM Limit 1 Ignition retard = 15 Deg


Then get a Gear Cut request is generated:


Gear Cut = 90% Cut

Gear Cut Ignition retard = 20 Deg.


The ECU will stop the RPM limit1, remove the 15 degree of retard, activate a 90% cut and apply 20 degrees retard.


**RPM Limit Function Setup**


Emtron has three different RPM Limiters and four different methods for each


* Config, Function Setup, Engine Functions, RPM Limit 1/2/3


Select the cut type and order of priority for each RPM limit function&nbsp;
