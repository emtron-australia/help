**Knock Threshold Cyl Gain Table**


This table is used to apply a multiplication factor to the knock threshold applied to cylinders individually.

The default table value is 1.00 giving equivalence to the Knock Threshold Table

By adjusting this table, one can bend the knock threshold across an alternative runtime and also each cylinder individually.

The Y-Axis can spanned across any runtime or disabled


\*\* The X-Axis MUST be set to the Cylinder Numbers

&nbsp;Example show - Porsche 996


This table is user defined and should only be adjusted and validated by an experienced tuner.

**Knock Level Cyl Gain Table**


This table is used to multiply the knock level measured at each cylinder individually

This is table is commonly used to effectively quieten noisy cylinders in relation to others to enable the use of a tight knock overall knock threshold.

By adjusting this table, one can bend affect volume of the knock signal source across an alternative runtime and also each cylinder individually.

Agani, the Y-Axis can spanned across any runtime or disabled. This table can be used on it's own or together with the (Above) Knock Threshold Cyl Gain Table

This table is user defined and should only be adjusted and validated by an experienced tuner.


\*\* The X-Axis MUST be set to the Cylinder Numbers
