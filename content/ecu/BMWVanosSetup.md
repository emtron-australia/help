**BMW VANOS Support**&nbsp;



Early BMW Motorsport VANOS systems were unique.&nbsp; It uses an auxiliary oil pump that boosts operating oil pressure to a constantly regulated 100bar of pressure.&nbsp; The high pressure is used to hydraulically lock the cam position to target during all operating conditions.&nbsp; The design of the system requires two channels per camshaft as there is no default position (ie â€“ Intake retarded position, exhaust advanced position).&nbsp; This means there are separate channels for each camshaft for retard and advance.&nbsp; If the control system is at target, the cams remained hydraulically locked by switching the control system off.&nbsp; Because of the unique mechanical nature of the system, ECU control must be very specific.&nbsp; Emtron has developed a special strategy that mimics the OE function, but allows complete flexibility to enable even more precise control.&nbsp;


BMW Engines that use high pressure BMW Motorsport VANOS&nbsp;

* BMW S50B30 &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Single VANOS intake cam
* BMW S50B32&nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Double VANOS intake and exhaust cam
* BMW S54 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Double VANOS intake and exhaust cam
* BMW S62 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Double VANOS intake and exhaust cam (two banks)

**\*\*\*** USA versions BMW S50B30 (and BMW S52B32) do NOT use BMW Motorsport VANOS.&nbsp; \*\*\*

**\*\*\*** Later Motorsport models updated VANOS to more conventional control. &nbsp; BMW S65 and BMW S85 use only one output per camshaft like conventional systems.\*\*\*

When selecting these function types, there will be additional options available for choosing the specific channels for retard or advance channels. &nbsp;

**\*\*\*** BMW Motorsport VANOS is driven high side.&nbsp; If the installer chooses to drive low side, the solenoids MUST be modified as the flyback diodes will now allow them to be driven low. Diodes must be reversed or removed.\*\*\*
