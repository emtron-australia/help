The Fuel Density Table is utilized by the Fuel Model to determine the fuel mass. &nbsp;

Fuel Temperature has a major influence on the fuel density and hence the mass of the fuel. &nbsp;

This 3D table can also account for fuel density changes based on any parameter in the ECU. &nbsp;

This setting is particularly useful when using multiple fuel compositions such as ethanol which also influence the fuel mass. &nbsp;


The Emtune software has pre determined Fuel Density Tables available in it that are only a right click of the mouse away

By selecting "Load Table" you can quickly arrive at the correct density table to suit commonly used fuels.

The Ethanol Fuel Density Table.etf is as shown in the example above \& spans the increase in ethanol against gasoline.

Methanol \& Gasoline specific Fuel density tables are also included.
