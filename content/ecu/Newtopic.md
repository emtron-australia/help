\*\* Many of these timers are pre-configured and function automatically. &nbsp;


**User Timers**


Timers must be enabled&nbsp;


* Config, Function Setup, Timer Functons


On

Off


**User Timer Setup**


Timers are configured in the Tuning section


* Tuning, Timer Functions


Configuring timer 1-5 opens up a configuration window to set conditions, max time, and Timer Reset Mode


Set the conditions for the timer to start using Emtron ECU runtimes or status.&nbsp; There are up to 4 conditions that can be used to start the timer. &nbsp;

\

**Max Time**

\
Set the max time the timer can count


**Timer Reset Mode**

\
Reset when Timer Function turns OFF


&nbsp; &nbsp; The timer will reset when the conditions are no longer met


Example:&nbsp;


Timer condition is \>3000 rpm, the timer will reset every time the engine speed falls below 3000rpm.&nbsp;


Reset when Timer Function turns ON


&nbsp; &nbsp; The timer will reset when the conditions are met again


Example:&nbsp;


Timer condition is \>3000 rpm, the timer will reset when the engine speed falls below 3000rpm, and then goes past it again


Never


&nbsp; &nbsp; The timer will not reset


**Fixed Timer Setup**


Fixed Timers are configured in the Tuning section
