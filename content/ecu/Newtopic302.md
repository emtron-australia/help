**Min/Max Deviation From Initial Position Table**


Allows the user to set the minimum and maximum deviation that can be used by the closed loop system.  

These parameters can be expanded into a 3D look up tables to provide greater accuracy regarding closed loop control.  

\

\*\* These values are Duty Cycle when using a solenoid, Step counts if using a stepper motor, or Position if using DBW.
