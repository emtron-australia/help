* Utilities, Scope


When you select Scope, it opens a new window with the Scope.&nbsp;

The scope function records the channel assignments to internal memory when started/stopped with the buttons at the top right.&nbsp; The memory can be subsequently downloaded, erased, saved, and loaded by the other buttons in the utility.&nbsp;


Configuration details are as follows:


Purple:

Select what channel to display, and whether you want the trace to be visible or not


Red:

Change the volts per division for each channel

The chart is divided in blocks up and down.&nbsp; Each block equals 2 volts in the above example. &nbsp;


Orange:

The traces can be offset so they do not overlay on top of each other.&nbsp; The default value is 0.00V, meaning the voltage will trace from the centre (so it will read +/- 0V).&nbsp; It is useful to offset the traces, so they can be all visible at the same time on the chart as in the above example. &nbsp;


Green:&nbsp;

Sec Offset moves the trace to a specific position


Blue:

Time Sec Per Div changes the zoom level of the scope by adjusting the time per division *horizontally*.&nbsp; Like voltage per division vertically.&nbsp; After starting and stopping the scope, this will need to be adjusted until a trace draws an appropriate picture as in the example above.&nbsp;


Light Blue:

Sample Rate should be adjusted to set the scope recording rate.&nbsp; In most cases the default value of 10ksps should be enough, but if scope traces are requested for troubleshooting purposes (on running engines for example â€“ not just for trigger decoding requests), then a higher speed may be requested. &nbsp;


\*\* Note a higher sampling rate will use up the Emtron internal memory much faster.&nbsp; A shorter period of recording should be anticipated (a few seconds generally). &nbsp;
