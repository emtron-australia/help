Emtron generates a number of “calculated” runtimes that offer a higher level of flexibility for tuning engines. &nbsp;


Efficiency Calculation&nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Percentage of Engine Efficiency (Commonly used for Fuel Tables)&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Load Calculation&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; Percentage of calculated Load (Commonly used for Ignition Tables)

&nbsp; &nbsp; % MAP/BAP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Manifold Pressure divided by Barometric pressure as a %&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; % MAP/ExhPress &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Manifold Pressure divided by Exhaust Pressure as a %

&nbsp; &nbsp; % TPS/BAP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Throttle Position divided by Barometric Pressure as a %

&nbsp; &nbsp; MAP Modelled&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; Modelled Manifold Pressure&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; MAP Modelled/BAP %&nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Modelled Manifold Pressure divided by Barometric pressure as a %&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Air Mass Final (mg/cyl) &nbsp; &nbsp; – &nbsp; &nbsp; Calculated final air mass as milligrams per cylinder

Manifold Pressure Estimate– &nbsp; &nbsp; Estimated Manifold Pressure

Exhaust Pressure Estimate– &nbsp; &nbsp; Estimate Exhaust Pressure
