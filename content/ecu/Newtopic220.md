title: "Cylinder Trim Tables"
---

Emtune has multiple tables for many engine functions.&nbsp; The table behavior is based on comprehensive selections in Tuning under the respective function (IE, Fuel, Ignition, DBW, Cam control).&nbsp; Some functions have many tables that can be enabled such as Fuel and Ignition tabs.&nbsp; These main functions allow you to enable a variety of compensations, modifiers, individual trims, and more. &nbsp;


For main table controls, the selections are mostly universal. &nbsp;

(Fuel example shown)

Not all of the above example will be available for every function, but generally most functions are the same. &nbsp;


**ON â€“ Table \*** enable those respective tables always.&nbsp;


**Cal Slot** enables which table is currently being commanded by the Cal Slot Control (see Cal Slot Control)


**Z-Axis** uses a separate X axis lookup that can allow the blending of all the available tables. &nbsp;

Any runtime can be used, and the units equal which table to run in this case.&nbsp; You can see in the above example the ECU will switch (and interpolate in between) the three different tables available based on TP1 position. &nbsp;


**\* Blend** tables allow switching between two tables only. &nbsp;
