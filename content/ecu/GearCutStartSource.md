Gear Cut Start Source&nbsp;


This is the source ECU uses to trigger the cut for gear shift.&nbsp; There are three methods that can be selected :


&#48;: Digitial Input set to Clutch Switch


This setting will allow the system to trigger by "Clutch.Switch" input.


&#49;: Digitial Input set to Gear Cut Switch


This setting will allow the system to trigger by "Gear Cut Switch" Input.&nbsp; Commonly this signal is supplied by a gear shifter mounted switch


&#50;: Gear Shift Force


This setting will allow the system to trigger by "Gear Shift Force" Input.&nbsp; Commonly this signal is supplied a gear shift mounted amplified strain gauge output.&nbsp; This is generally the best method for triggering but does require hardware which can provide the ECU a voltage output based on the force.
