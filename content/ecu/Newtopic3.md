---

**Difference between LSU4.9 ADV and LSU 4.9**


**Heater Power and Light-Off Times:** The LSU4.9 Adv has a bigger heater element allowing the sensor to start operating sooner when compared to a LSU4.9:

LSU4.9 ADV has a 8.7W heater -&nbsp; 5sec lite-off time from cold to start operating

LSU4.9 has a 7.5W heater - 12sec lite-off time from cold to start operating


**Temperature Range:** The LSU4.9 ADV has a wider working temperature range (930DegC). A version of this sensor called the ”LSU 4.9 Adv pre-Turbo” is also available and has a protection tube of Inconel for pre-turbo applications.&nbsp;


**Sensor Element:** LSU4.9 ADV has a new generation sensor element which is ideal for motorsport as it improves stability under thermal shock conditions.


**Service Life** - 200Hrs Example&nbsp;

LSU4.9 response time will slow over time.

LSU4.9 ADV response time will show no significant change over this time.


**Connector:** The LSU 4.9 Adv has no trimming resistor inside the connector (pin 5) and is therefore only a 5-wire plug. This also means any connector system can be used if required (cut off the connector and re-terminate).
