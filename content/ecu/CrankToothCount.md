Crank Tooth Count


This value specifies the total number of symmetrical teeth or slots in the multi-tooth trigger.

**Warning** - A valid tooth count must divide **evenly** into 360 degrees.&nbsp;

Note: Where a trigger wheel has teeth missing, this value must be set to the number of teeth that would of been counted if the teeth were not missing.
