## What is included, and what kind of support should be expected from Emtron?

Emtron provides worldwide technical support to our dealers and customers, with support staff located around the globe for fast response regardless of your time zone.  Our team includes expert calibrators, who have worked on countless applications and engine configurations, and have a comprehensive understanding of the Emtron hardware and software product line to help answer your questions and troubleshoot issues.  

While our support staff are absolutely here to answer questions, support hardware issues, and help point you in the right direction - for a wide variety of reasons, unfortunately our `staff cannot tune customer vehicles`, provide more than basic base/start up maps, or teach fundamentals of engine tuning or even basic fundamentals of the software.  Emtron software and hardware is incredibly capable and sophisticated, but deserves some dedication and time to learn and understand full functionality.   

Emtron support is here to guide experienced tuners in the use of the hardware and software, as well as to ensure there are no problems with the hardware or software.  Emtron provides training sessions around the world annually and we encourage all dealers and self-tuning end-customers to sign up for these events.  In addition Emtron recommends EFI University's series of classes particularly those focused on the use of Emtune software. Furthermore, Emtron's dealer network consists of some of the best tuners in the world - for end-customers seeking one-on-one support and training in the product, we strongly suggest you contact Emtron dealers in your geography to see how they can help you achieve your goals.

## What to include in your support requests

**Cal File and Logs:** 9 out of 10 times, support staff will need to review the working calibration file and any log file of the conditions in question.

PC logging is the best way to capture the log, as it will record all channels for the staff to review.

> **IMPORTANT** If calibration files are locked, our support staff will **NOT** be able to unlock them. Please provide the password for the cal file in the request, or send unlocked versions of the cal file.

*Our support staff do not further record, database, or share any users cal files, passwords, etc.*
