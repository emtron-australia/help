## Derivative Gain Table

Derivative gain controls predictive correction where gain is based on the rate of change of error.  

This function is used to prevent overshooting targets by looking at a number of factors like rate of change, and P and I gain. 

This parameter can be expanded into a 3D look up table to provide greater accuracy regarding closed loop control.
