## Exhaust Cam Angle Target Tables

This is the Exhaust camshaft position command tables where the required camshaft position in degrees is set

Table units start from 0. 

Negative numbers represent targeting retarded position of the camshaft.  

    Exhaust target map = -20 degrees = 20 degrees of exhaust cam retard

**Typically numbers close to 0 represent the least amount of overlap which helps with idling. 

Exhaust Cam Angle Target Table 2 can be accessed/activated via Cam Target Table Control

There are a variety of methods of integration available.

*****WARNING*****

Incorrect setting of the Exhaust Cam Angle Target Table can result in engine damage.

In modified engines, the piston to valve clearance of the engine should be measured.

The maximum safe advance angle should be known prior to setting VVT travel range.  

If the valve clearance is compromised within the available travel range a mechaincal limit should be employed to prevent contact.

**DO NOT** rely on closed loop Cam Control to prevent piston to valve contact when there is a mechanical ability to cause contact.

**BMW Motorsport VANOS should not be targeted to the fully retarded or advanced position at any point.

This is because the system is designed to hydraulically lock the position once at the target (no solenoid regulation). 

If for whatever reason the offset position is not exact (some variance with temp, engine speed, etc), the system could potentially over-regulate the solenoids.

Targeting a few degrees before each end stop is typical and mimics the OE function.
