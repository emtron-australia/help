Pre-Crank Multi Pulse Count

On Ethanol base fuels significantly more pre-crank is required to 

start the engine.  However long pre-crank pulses can cause the 

fuel to enter a liquid state, normally contaminating the spark plugs

and inhibiting good starting . 

The solution is a shorter pulse width but more pulses.

Pre-Crank Multi Pulse Interval

The time between consecutive pre-crank prime pulses.

(Only applies when more than 1 pulse is used)
