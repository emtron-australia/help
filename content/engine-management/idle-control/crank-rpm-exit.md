**Tuning Tip**: 

*Should you have an engine that is difficult to initially cold start, that is it doesn't start on first crank, rather on the second or third attempt, then increasing the Crank RPM Exit  in some instances can help. This allows the engine to utilize the Crank Comp Table for a little longer allowing for a faster start and quicker handover to a run condition.*
