**Ref Static Fuel Pressure (Prim)**&nbsp;


![Image](</img/Config Fuel6.jpg>)


Reference static fuel pressure is set without the engine running at the current barometric pressure. &nbsp;

It is important that this setting is correct especially when the fuel pressure is enabled as part of the "fuel model". &nbsp;

The ECU will correct the fueling if the fuel pressure goes above or below the differential fuel pressure. &nbsp;

The "Differential Fuel Pressure Offset" should be 0 or close to under normal operating conditions.


&#49;) When "Fuel Model: Fuel Pressure" setting is ON&nbsp;

&#50;) Provides a Diff Fuel Pressure Offset runtime.
