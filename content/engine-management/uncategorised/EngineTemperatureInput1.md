FIlter Setting Minimum = 0&nbsp; (OFF)

FIlter Setting Maximum = 50

Recommended Filter Range = 40 - 45


**Specs**


Minimum Value = -50.0 DegC

Maximum Value = 250.0 DegC

Resolution&nbsp; = 0.1 DegC

Accuracy = +/-0.5 DegC&nbsp;


The ECU measures the 5V pull-up supply, then applies a ratio-metric correction to give very accurate measurements.
