**Manifold Pressure Input**


**Filter Settings**


FIlter Setting Minimum = 0&nbsp; (OFF)

FIlter Setting Maximum = 50&nbsp; &nbsp;

Recommended Filter Range = 15 - 25. This setting is heavily dependent on engine setup and the stability of the MAP signal at idle. Engines with large overlapping camshafts for example, will most likely need a larger filter value to achieve a more stable MAP signal.


**Specs**


Minimum Value = 0.0 kPa

Maximum Value = 1000.0 kPa

Resolution&nbsp; = 0.1 kPa

Accuracy = +/-0.1 kPa


The ECU measures the MAP Sensor Supply, then applies a ratio-metric correction to give a very accurate measuremens. What this means is the MAP sensor output is not affected but its supply voltage.
