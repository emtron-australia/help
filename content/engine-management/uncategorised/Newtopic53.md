**Continuous Logger**



When connected to the ECU live, using the "P" key will "Pause" the software completely, and allow the user to navigate back a number of seconds using any line plots on the screen and see exactly where they were in the ECU software. &nbsp;

This mode acts as if they were live tuning the ECU in that very instant.


All hot keys such as "L", "M", or any other changes to the calibration are active during this mode, using the paused channel information available at that time. &nbsp;
