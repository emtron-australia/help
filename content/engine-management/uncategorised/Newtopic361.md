**Power Supply,**

When a correctly configured Ethernet port is in use together with a known good communication cable and you remain unable to establish a connection.&nbsp;

Power supply to the ECU must be verified. That is, the next step is to determine if the ECU is powering up.&nbsp;

Without voltage to the ECU supply pin.

The ECU will fail to power up thereby making communication impossible.

For the KV Series ECU’s this is pin D1

For the SL series ECU’s, this is pin B1

If 12V is not present at D1/B1 with ignition ON, you will need to determine the power supply fault.
