**Throttle Body Model**

**Introduction**&nbsp;

The throttle body model is a key component to unlocking the advanced tuning features of the Emtron ECU. That is Throttle Mass Flow \& Torque Modeling \& Management. The accuracy of your setup in the throttle body mode is critical for good results.&nbsp;

Once the throttle mass flow feature is characterized and enabled, the throttle body model setup can be accessed and setup

The Throttle Body setup consists of 2 main parts:

* Throttle body diameter and scaler.&nbsp;
* Throttle body area table.&nbsp;

See the [*DBW Torque Management*](<DBWTorqueMang.md>)  help topic for more information on the process of converting Pedal Position to Throttle Area to DBW Servo target.
