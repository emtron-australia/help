**Firing Order Setup**


This is where the firing order of the engine is set.&nbsp; The base angles for each cylinder are also entered. &nbsp;

Most engines are even fired which means each firing event occurs and equal angle from the last. &nbsp;

Per example below :&nbsp;

A 4 Cylinder, 4 Stroke, even fire engine. &nbsp;

Commonly the firing order would be 1-3-4-2. &nbsp;

Base angles would be 0-180-360-540.&nbsp;


Even fire engines can use the Generate Base Angles tab when the firing order in known.

Odd fire engines can have the Base Angles entered manually as shown below for a Dodge Viper setup.
