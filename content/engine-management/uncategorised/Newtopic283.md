Proportional Gain controls how aggressive instantaneous correction is based on the current target error vs Transport Delay

\*\* When using Dual Lambda Control - Lambda 1/2 Target Error - Shared must be used for the gain table to operated on the individual sensors


\*\* Transport Delay must be set correctly
