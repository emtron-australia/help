**Derivative Gain Table**

\

Derivative gain controls predictive correction.  This function is used to prevent overshooting targets by looking at a number of factors like rate of change, and P and I gain.

This parameter can be expanded into a 3D look up table to provide greater accuracy regarding closed loop control.
