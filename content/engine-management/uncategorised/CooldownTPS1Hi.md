title: "Cooldown TPS1 Hi"
---

When TPS1 Signal is above this value the engine speed is not limited to the Cooldown Idle Target. Between TPS1 Lo and TPS1 Hi the ECU will remove the Cooldown Idle limit .&nbsp; This allows the vehicle to be drive while still in cooldown mode.


NOTE: TPS1 Hi MUST be greater than TPS Lo
