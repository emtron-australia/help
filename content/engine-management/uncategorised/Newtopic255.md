**Engine Speed Limiter Setup**

\

**Cut Pattern**

\

Select the cut pattern type

.

&#48;: Random Pattern 1

&#49;: Random Pattern 2

&#50;: Sequential Pattern 1

&#51;: Sequential Pattern 2


**Ign Retard Mode**


Applies the Ignition Retard as either an Offset or Percentage of Base Angle (Table value)


Example: Current Ignition Angle = 25.0 BTDC


Offset = 15.0 Deg Retard.&nbsp; Ignition Angle During&nbsp;

Limiting = 25.0 - 15.0 = 10.0 Deg&nbsp; BTDC


Percentage = 50.0 % Retard.&nbsp;

Ignition Base Angle = 20.0 Deg.

Ignition Angle During&nbsp; Limiting = 20 - 50% x 20.0 = 10.0 Deg BTDC

(assuming no other Ignition trims)


**Control Range**


Control Range (-/+) RPM Units


The Control Range applies to the Min/Max % Cut values


Example :&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Min % Cut Clamp 10%

Max % Cut Clamp 90%

Control Range -200rpm

RPM Limit 7000rpm&nbsp;


At 6800rpm the engine will begin its cut routine at the Min % Cut Clamp of 10%

At 7000rpm the engine will finish its cut routine at the Max % Cut Clamp of 90%&nbsp;


**Minimum %Cut Clamp**


Percentage cut applied to the engine at the start of the control range.


**Maximum %Cut Clamp**


Percentage cut applied to the engine at the end of the control range.


NOTE: Maximum Cut MUST be \> Minimum Cut


**Hard Limit Adder**


Used in Limit types 2 and 3.


Added to the start on the limit and determines the point at which a 100% cut will be applied.


Example:

Limit Type = 2 (Fuel Cut + Ign Hard Cut)

RPM Limit = 7000

Control Range = -200 RPM

Hard Limit Adder = 180 RPM


Fuel %cut Engine Limiting starts at 6800 at the Minimum %Cut

Fuel %cut Engine Limiting ends at 7000 at the Maximum %Cut

Ign 100% cut occurs at 6980 RPM and above.


**dRPM Gain**


Compensates for a fast rate of change in engine speed by reducing the limit value. &nbsp;


Used to prevent the engine&nbsp; pushing through the limit.


Locked out when&nbsp; dRPM \< 2000 RPM/sec.


A Gain of 100 will reduce the limit by 100 RPM for every dRPM 1000 RPM/sec over the 2000 start threshold.


Example 1:

dRPM Gain = 100

RPM limit = 6500

dRPM = 3000 RPM/sec


New RPM Limit = 6500 - 100 = 6400


Example 2:

dRPM Gain = 100

RPM limit = 6500

dRPM = 4000 RPM/sec


New RPM Limit = 6500 - 200 = 6300


&#48; = OFF


**Ignition Retard**


The amount of Ignition Retard applied during limiting.


There are 2 modes :

&nbsp;- Offset (Deg)

\-&nbsp; Percentage (%)


**Post Start Lockout**


Will prevent the limit operating during crank and for a time after the engine has started.


Useful when channels like oil pressure are assigned to an RPM limiter function.


\*\* Using the Engine Protection Control function is highly recommended instead
