**Fuel Model : Fuel Pressure**


Fuel Model: Fuel Pressure Corr.


Fuel Pressure Correction - Primary Injectors

&nbsp; &nbsp; \*\* Secondary Injectors configured separately


Includes the Fuel Pressure in the Fuel Model Calculation.&nbsp; The ECU is able to automatically adjust the Mass Injector Flow based on the differential pressure across the Injector.


\*\* NOTE: ONLY uses Fuel Pressure 1 Input Channel \*\*


&#48;: OFF

&#49;: ON (Fuel Press Corr - Sensor Fitted)

&#50;: ON (Static Fuel Pressure - No Sensor)



&#48; = ECU will not correct fuel mass at all.&nbsp; This means the Fuel Mass Calculation is functioning solely off the Ref Injector Size (Primary) and Ref Static Fuel Pressure (Prim). &nbsp;

\*\* Using a Vacuum Referenced (rising/falling rate regulator) should provide stable differential pressure.&nbsp;

&#49; = ECU will calculate new fuel mass requirements based on deviation from Ref Static Fuel Pressure (Prim) value.&nbsp;

&#50; = ECU will calculate differential pressure loss (without a sensor) assuming the Ref Static Fuel Pressure (Prim) cannot be maintained due to having a non-vacuum referenced/rising rate fuel pressure regulation system installed (static pressure all the time). &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;


Channels to reference :&nbsp;


* Fuel Pressure 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Pressure value generated by calculated channel - as calibrated by input setup
* Fuel Pressure 1 Diff &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Effective/Relative/Differential pressure across injector - uses Injector Nozzel Ref Pressure to calculate
* Fuel Pressure 1 Diff Offset &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - +/- pressure deviation from Ref Static Fuel Pressure (Prim)
* Fuel Model - Fuel Pressure Correction (Prim) % &nbsp; &nbsp; - Percentage of Fuel Mass correction applied due to Fuel Pressure 1 Diff Offset &nbsp;


**\*\* Recommended Setting - "1" due to Vacuum Referenced regulators not always providing 1:1 pressure change vs Injector Nozzle Ref Pressure and other inadequacies of most fuel systems (starvation, voltage supply, out-flowing, etc)**

\*\* Observe Lambda staying on target with negative Fuel 1 Diff Offset, and Positive Fuel Model - Fuel Pressure Correction (Prim)&nbsp;
