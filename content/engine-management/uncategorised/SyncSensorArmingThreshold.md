**Sync Sensor Arming Threshold**

Arming thresholds for digital signals (including crank and sync sensors) describe the level in which the voltage level must go **above** before the signal can be valid.&nbsp; Regardless of signal (magnetic, or digital), the threshold voltage level must be reached before the signal can be considered valid. &nbsp;

\*\* The threshold value does not mean this is the value in which the ECU "triggers". &nbsp;

Magnetic sensors increase the magnitude of the wave form with rpm&nbsp;

**Note:** This option is available on ALL trigger types.&nbsp;

On any square wave 0- 5V signal it is recommend to set the arming threshold to 2.0V flat across the table.


\*\* Use the scope function within the Emtron to validate the voltage threshold to be used.&nbsp; **See Scope - Uses of Scope**
