Gasoline to Ethanol Stoichiometric Custom Table example shown - available to load in Emtune software


This table is used by the ECU to determine the stoichiometric fuel ratio. &nbsp;

This is critical when multiple fuel compositions are used. &nbsp;

The most common application of this table is in a multi fuel system which uses a flex meter to determine the alcohol content. &nbsp;
