Offset or Percentage of Current Ign Angle


Example: Current Ignition Angle = 20.0 BTDC


Offset = 15.0 Deg Retard. &nbsp;

Ignition Angle during Gear Cut is

\= 20.0 - 15.0 = 5.0 Deg&nbsp; BTDC


Percentage = 50.0 % Retard.&nbsp;

Ignition Angle During&nbsp; Cut :

\= 20 - 50% x 20.0 = 10.0 Deg BTDC
