**Integral Gain Table**

Integral gain controls how much adaptive correction is needed over time.

&#48;.1 is a good starting value


\*\* Above example shows under higher engine loads Integral is phased out and under higher lambda target error.&nbsp; This is to help eliminate Integral corrections from interfering with Proportional correction
