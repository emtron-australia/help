**Derivative Gain Table**


Derivative gain controls predictive correction where gain is based on the rate of change of error. &nbsp;

This function is used to prevent overshooting targets by looking at a number of factors like rate of change, and P and I gain.&nbsp;

This parameter can be expanded into a 3D look up table to provide greater accuracy regarding closed loop control.&nbsp;
