Gear Cut Start Source 

This is the source ECU uses to trigger the cut for gear shift.  There are three methods that can be selected :

0: Digitial Input set to Clutch Switch

This setting will allow the system to trigger by "Clutch.Switch" input.

1: Digitial Input set to Gear Cut Switch

This setting will allow the system to trigger by "Gear Cut Switch" Input.  Commonly this signal is supplied by a gear shifter mounted switch

2: Gear Shift Force

This setting will allow the system to trigger by "Gear Shift Force" Input.  Commonly this signal is supplied a gear shift mounted amplified strain gauge output.  This is generally the best method for triggering but does require hardware which can provide the ECU a voltage output based on the force.
