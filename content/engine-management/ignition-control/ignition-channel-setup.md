This tables assigns an Ignition Channel to a Cylinder Number. 

A 0 value indicates this channel is not used for Ignition and is therefore available for other functions.

For Wasted Spark applications list the first cylinder in the firing pair. 

The ECU will determine the second cylinder in the pairing from the firing order table.
