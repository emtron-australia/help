## Nissan GT-R R35

Nissan GTR R35 dedicated menu shown with GTR R35 build enabled

The Nissan R35 GT-R's turbo control system and monitoring is different than many turbocharged cars. 

Commonly turbocharged engines have a common plenum that feeds all the engines cylinders. 

Each cylinder draws air from a common plenum. 

On the Nissan R35 GT-R one bank feeds one set of three cylinders(1-3) and the other turbo feeds the other three cylinders (4-6) via separated plenum's. There is also a cross over balance pipe between the plenum's. 

To correctly calculate the fueling requirements for each bank the ECU uses MAF Meter 1 (Bank 1) to control the fueling on Cylinders 1-3 and MAF Meter 2 (Bank 2) to control the fueling on Cylinders 4-6. There are also boost pressure sensors on each bank along with a single manifold pressure sensor on one bank. These pressure sensors allow for various calculations to be made by the ECU, offering a number methods to use for fuel calculations. 

The Emtron R35 GT-R Plug-in ECU is a replacement engine management system designed to be installed and integrate seamlessly with the vehicle, whilst also allowing extreme flexibility and control from the KV12 based ECU platform. 

The Nissan GTR R35 tab allows access to dedicated R35 features:

**▪ Nissan Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC)** – This system employs an extremely complex system of vehicle sensors including wheel speed, steering angle, g-force and yaw which are used to generate various torque requests which the ECU must abide by accurately. This will not only achieve maximum vehicle performance, it is also a safety feature. 

**▪ Nissan Transmission Control Module Integration (TCM)** - The ECU must accurately calculate and perform torque requests assigned by the TCM for the drive-train to function correctly and smoothly for all driving conditions. Limitations on the transmission torque capacity must also be considered and hence another reason why the torque supplied by the engine must be accurately metered.
