## Boost Solenoid Ddeadtime Table (ms)

This look up table defines the deadtime of the Boost Solenoid.

The deadtime of the solenoid is crucial where control of the boost solenoid duty cycle is especially crucial – IE applications using Push-Pull solenoids or 4-port solenoid control.  

**Note – Deadtime will automatically add Boost Valve Position %

** Tuning tip – 

A good way to set solenoid deadtime is to do it on a bench and monitor leakage through the valve.  Increase deadtime until the brink of leakage, and deadtime is correct.
