## ECU Overview/Pinout

The cal file information such as pin configuration, assignments, and even the FW version can easily be accessed via the file menu under "Show ECU Overview"

## Setting Paths

Paths can be reset under the file menu under "Options".

## Unit Preferences


Units can be converted under the file menu under "Options".

## ECU Cal FIle Locking

ECU Cal Files can be locked under the file menu (Password protection).

{{% badge style="caution" %}}The ECU cal file **cannot be unlocked** by Emtron Support for any reason if it is locked, as this is done in the actual calibration file.{{% /badge %}}

The user is free to load in any cal file they please though, including an unlocked cal file (on top of a locked cal file).

Loading in a new cal file will overwrite the cal file loaded into the ECU, so that current cal file will be lost.

If a cal file is locked, Emtune will allow the user to view the "ECU Overview" though to see what the current pinout of the ECU is.

## Viewing Runtimes

Pressing "F3" anytime the ECU is open will display all calculated channels in real time.
Navigate through the tabs, or "Search" for the channel you are looking to view.


## Output Testing

All outputs can be tested in the ECU, and this is a recommended procedure before running the engine and crucial components for the first time.

Outputs controlled by functions, can be tested right from the function output setup. The "Test Output" button brings you to this section, where you can set conditions for the output test :

To test fuel and ignition channels, this is done under Config Fuel/Ignition \> Injector/Ignition Test

Set the pulse width/dwell for the test, and then turn the channels on to test. &nbsp;

{{% badge style="caution" %}}Do not test channels with the engine running{{% /badge %}}

> **Note:** The channels are the actual channel assignments from the ECU, and not the cylinder assignments - IE if you have cylinders assigned on different channels, they will NOT correspond during this test.


## Starting Engine/No Start

Once configuration is complete, startability of the engine can be observed (and logged) in Runtimes view (F3) under Triggers/Limits \> Engine Decoding Status.

For sequential configuration, Crank, Sync, 360, and 720 sync must all go "Green" in order for the decoding to be satisfied and the engine startability to be achieved. &nbsp;

> **Tip** Engine Speed should be observed cranking as well

On universal configurations such as "Multi-tooth Custom", if the engine will not start, the stroke for sequential firing may be on the wrong phase.

An easy way to correct this is to add 360 degrees to the Crank Index Offset value.


### Engine Limiting Active

The Emtron ECU can perform a number of different limit types. View what limiters are active in Runtime view (F3) under Triggers/Limits.

Limit Requests will show the specific limiter active

Under Limit Summary, Highest priority Fcut/Icut Status will also show the current limiter active (by priority of cut %)

> **Tip:** Highest priority cuts are recommended to always be logged.


### Trigger Errors

The following Error channels are calculated in the ECU.

* `Crank/Sync Errors` - This is a counter that will register if the ECU sees an issue during an engine cycle where the Crank Tooth and Sync Tooth are not legitimate.
* `Crank/Sync Errors(crk)` - This error is the same as Crank/Sync Errors but occurs inside the Cranking Speed entry window (Crank RPM Entry and Crank RPM exit).
* `Crank Tooth Errors` - This is a counter that will register if the ECU sees the incorrect number of expected count of crank teeth during an engine cycle.
* `Sync Tooth Errors` - This is a counter that will register if the ECU sees the incorrect number expected sync teeth during an engine cycle,

{{% badge style="info" %}}All trigger errors when they register will result in engine misfire as the ECU will attempt to abort running the engine for that cycle (cut). This is to prevent the engine from running improper timing or improper cycle.{{% /badge %}}


## Data Logging/Diagnostic Tips

* Crank Tooth, Crank/Sync, Crank/Sync(crk) counting during engine cranking/low battery voltage sometimes can be considered normal depending on the trigger type, tooth count, engine compression ratio, etc.&nbsp;

* This is due to the ECU attempting to scrutinize the trigger accurately during cranking, missing teeth, crank index teeth, etc.
* `Crank Tooth Errors` alone usually mean the main Crank Index Signal has issues
* `Crank/Sync Errors` alone usually mean there is a Sync Sensor Signal issue.
* `Crank Tooth Errors` AND `Crank/Sync Errors` usually mean there is interference/rouge on one or both of the main trigger inputs. Investigate the Sync Signal first with the ECU Scope.
