## Integral Gain Table

Integral gain controls how much adaptive correction is needed over time.

0.1 is a good starting value

** Above example shows under higher engine loads Integral is phased out and under higher lambda target error.  This is to help eliminate Integral corrections from interfering with Proportional correction
