## Emtune Update V1.19
*1 Sept 2020*
### New Features
 - MAJOR UPDATE - An expansion of the Emtron web server now adds the ability of Emtune auto updates and allows the latest version to operate in a backwards compatibility mode.  Emtune will detect the version of firmware in the connected ECU or desired ECU cal file opened in offline mode and will apply the correct menu settings.  This ensures calibration settings such as tables and menu items in Emtune will sync with the corresponding major firmware build version.
