While Emtron supports a high number of trigger types, there is occasionally the need to add new engine types. 

The fastest way to get support for a new engine type is to provide Emtron directly with scope file directly from the Emtune software (exported from the Scope Utility as a *.esf file).  

>If the vehicle has VVT (variable valve timing), please contact support for any special instructions. 

>[!INFO] A cranking scope trace with cylinder 1 spark plug removed (or only cylinder 1 spark plug installed) can be helpful in identifying an approximation of **crank index offset position**. The cranking speed will speed up/slow down at the point of compression.
