## Manifold Pressure Estimate Setup

0: OFF

1: Table Value

    Manifold Pressure Estimate Table = Raw Value 

Table value = 50.8% 

Manifold Pressure Estimate =  50.8 kPa (1:1)

2: % Barometric Pressure

Table value = 50.8% 

Barometric Pressure = 96.8kPa

Manifold Pressure Estimate =  96.8kPa x 50.8% = 49.1kPa

3: % Manifold Pressure

Table value = 50.8% 

Manifold Pressure = 96.8kPa

Manifold Pressure Estimate =  96.8kPa x 50.8% = 49.1kPa

4: % Manifold Pressure Bank 1/2 Average

Table value = 50.8% 

Manifold Pressure Bank 1/2 Average = 96.8kPa

Manifold Pressure Estimate =  96.8kPa x 50.8% = 49.1kPa

5: % Boost Pressure

Table value = 50.8% 

Boost Pressure = 253.6kPa

Manifold Pressure Estimate =  253.6kPa x 50.8% = 128.8kPa

6: % Boost Pressure Bank 1/2 Average

Table value = 50.8% 

Boost Pressure Bank 1/2 Average = 253.6kPa

Manifold Pressure Estimate =  253.6kPa x 50.8% = 128.8kPa
