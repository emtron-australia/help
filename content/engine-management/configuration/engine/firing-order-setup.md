## Firing Order Setup

This is where the firing order of the engine is set.  The base angles for each cylinder are also entered.  

Most engines are even fired which means each firing event occurs and equal angle from the last.

Per example below : 

A 4 Cylinder, 4 Stroke, even fire engine.  

Commonly the firing order would be 1-3-4-2.  

Base angles would be 0-180-360-540. 

Even fire engines can use the Generate Base Angles tab when the firing order in known.

Odd fire engines can have the Base Angles entered manually as shown below for a Dodge Viper setup.
