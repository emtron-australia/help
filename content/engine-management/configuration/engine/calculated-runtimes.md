## Calculated Runtimes

![Image](</img/Ignition18.jpg>)

Emtron generates a number of “calculated” runtimes that offer a higher level of flexibility for tuning engines.  

Efficiency Calculation    –     Percentage of Engine Efficiency (Commonly used for Fuel Tables) 

    Load Calculation    -    Percentage of calculated Load (Commonly used for Ignition Tables)

    % MAP/BAP         -     Manifold Pressure divided by Barometric pressure as a % 

    % MAP/ExhPress     -     Manifold Pressure divided by Exhaust Pressure as a %

    % TPS/BAP         -     Throttle Position divided by Barometric Pressure as a %

    MAP Modelled          -     Modelled Manifold Pressure 

    MAP Modelled/BAP %    –     Modelled Manifold Pressure divided by Barometric pressure as a % 

    Air Mass Final (mg/cyl)     –     Calculated final air mass as milligrams per cylinder

Manifold Pressure Estimate–     Estimated Manifold Pressure

Exhaust Pressure Estimate–     Estimate Exhaust Pressure
