## Fuel Model : Fuel Pressure

Fuel Model: Fuel Pressure Corr.

Fuel Pressure Correction - Primary Injectors

    ** Secondary Injectors configured separately

Includes the Fuel Pressure in the Fuel Model Calculation.  The ECU is able to automatically adjust the Mass Injector Flow based on the differential pressure across the Injector.

** NOTE: ONLY uses Fuel Pressure 1 Input Channel **

0: OFF

1: ON (Fuel Press Corr - Sensor Fitted)

2: ON (Static Fuel Pressure - No Sensor)

0 = ECU will not correct fuel mass at all.  This means the Fuel Mass Calculation is functioning solely off the Ref Injector Size (Primary) and Ref Static Fuel Pressure (Prim).  

** Using a Vacuum Referenced (rising/falling rate regulator) should provide stable differential pressure. 

1 = ECU will calculate new fuel mass requirements based on deviation from Ref Static Fuel Pressure (Prim) value. 

2 = ECU will calculate differential pressure loss (without a sensor) assuming the Ref Static Fuel Pressure (Prim) cannot be maintained due to having a non-vacuum referenced/rising rate fuel pressure regulation system installed (static pressure all the time).  

    

Channels to reference : 

* Fuel Pressure 1                         - Pressure value generated by calculated channel - as calibrated by input setup
* Fuel Pressure 1 Diff                     - Effective/Relative/Differential pressure across injector - uses Injector Nozzel Ref Pressure to calculate
* Fuel Pressure 1 Diff Offset                 - +/- pressure deviation from Ref Static Fuel Pressure (Prim)
* Fuel Model - Fuel Pressure Correction (Prim) %     - Percentage of Fuel Mass correction applied due to Fuel Pressure 1 Diff Offset  

**** Recommended Setting - "1" due to Vacuum Referenced regulators not always providing 1:1 pressure change vs Injector Nozzle Ref Pressure and other inadequacies of most fuel systems (starvation, voltage supply, out-flowing, etc)**
