Fuel Model: Charge Temp

Includes the Charge Temperature in the Fuel Model Speed Density Calculation.  The ECU is then able to automatically adjust the Air Mass (g) based on this temperature. 

When selected to ON the Charge Temp Comp table(s) should initially be set to zero

When Selected to OFF the Fuel Model uses a default value of 20.0 DegC and the Charge Temp Comp Table is therefore required to  provide Charge Temp Compensations.

Recommended Setting = ON
