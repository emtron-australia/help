Gasoline to Ethanol Stoichiometric Custom Table example shown - available to load in Emtune software

This table is used by the ECU to determine the stoichiometric fuel ratio.  

This is critical when multiple fuel compositions are used.  

The most common application of this table is in a multi fuel system which uses a flex meter to determine the alcohol content.
