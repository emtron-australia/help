## Efficiency Calculation

** Efficiency Calculation is used for Fuel Tables

Select how the runtime calculates Efficiency Calculation

0: MAP

    Manifold Pressure converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    MAP = 55.7kpa

Efficiency Calculation = 55.7%

1: TPS

    Throttle Position converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    TPS = 98.5%

Efficiency Calculation = 98.5% 

2: BAP

    Barometric Pressure converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    BAP = 93.4kpa

Efficiency Calculation = 93.4%

3: MAP/BAP %

    Manifold Pressure divided by Barometric Pressure converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    

MAP = 85kpa

BAP = 87kpa

Efficiency Calculation = (85/87)*100 = 97.70%

4: MAP/EMAP %

Manifold Pressure divided by Barometric Pressure converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    

MAP = 220kpa

EMAP = 240kpa

Efficiency Calculation = (220/240)*100 = 91.66%

5: TPS/BAP %

    Throttle Position divided by Barometric pressure converted to Efficiency Calculation  %

TPS = 98%

BAP = 85kpa

Efficiency Calculation = (98/85)*100 = 115.29%

6: Air Mas Final (mg/cyl)

    Air Mass milligrams per cycle converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    

    Air Mass = 0.121g/cyl

    Efficiency Calculation = 0.121*1000 = 121%

    

    Air Mass = 1.373g/cyl

    Efficiency Calculation = 1.373*1000 = 1373%

7: MAP Bank 1 & 2 Avg

    Manifold Pressure Bank 1 and 2 averaged together converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    MAP Bank 1 = 224kpa

    MAP Bank 2 = 236kpa

    Efficiency Calculation = 224+236/2 = 230%

8: MAP Modelled

    Manifold Pressure Modelled converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    Manifold Pressure Modelled = 155kpa

    Efficiency Calculation = 155%

9: MAP Modelled Bank 1 & 2 Avg

    Manifold Pressure Modelled Bank 1 and 2 averaged together converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    MAP Modelled Bank 1 = 224kpa

    MAP Modelled Bank 2 = 236kpa

    Efficiency Calculation = 224+236/2 = 230%

10 : MAP Modelled/BAP %

Manifold Pressure Modelled divided by Barometric Pressure converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    

MAP Modelled = 85kpa

BAP = 98kpa

Efficiency Calculation = (85/98)*100 = 86.73%

11: MAP Modelled Bank 1 & 2 Avg/BAP %

Manifold Pressure Modelled Bank 1 and 2 averaged together, divided by Barometric Pressure, and converted to Efficiency Calculation %

    MAP Modelled Bank 1 = 75kpa

    MAP Modelled Bank 2 = 78kpa

    BAP = 90kpa

    Efficiency Calculation = ((75+78/2)/90)*100 = 85%
