## Ref Static Fuel Pressure (Prim)

![Image](</img/Config Fuel6.jpg>)

Reference static fuel pressure is set without the engine running at the current barometric pressure.  

It is important that this setting is correct especially when the fuel pressure is enabled as part of the "fuel model".  

The ECU will correct the fueling if the fuel pressure goes above or below the differential fuel pressure.  

The "Differential Fuel Pressure Offset" should be 0 or close to under normal operating conditions.

1) When "Fuel Model: Fuel Pressure" setting is ON 

2) Provides a Diff Fuel Pressure Offset runtime.
