Input Shaft Speed is available on Channels DI 1- 8 on the KV Series and DI1-4 on the SL Series. The units are RPM.

See [Speed Settings](<SpeedSettings1.md>) for information on sensor setup.

## Input Shaft Speed Calculation

With 0% Clutch Slip, for the Input Shaft RPM to match the Engine Speed the Scaler should be calculated as follows:

Scaler =                  60                    

             Number teeth on Input Shaft

**Example1**:  4 teeth on the Input Shaft

Scaler = 60 / 4 = 15.00

**Example1:**  7 teeth on the Input Shaft

Scaler = 60 / 7 = 8.57
