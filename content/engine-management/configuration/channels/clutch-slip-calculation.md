Clutch Slip Calculation uses 2 Inputs:

1) Engine Speed (RPM)

2) Input Shaft Speed (RPM)

Example.

Engine Speed = 6000

Input Shaft Speed = 5756 RPM

Clutch Slip(%) =   Input Shaft Speed - Engine Speed

                Engine Speed

Clutch Slip(%) =  -4.06 % 

This means the Input Shaft is rotating 4.06% slower than the Engine Speed... i.e 4.06% Clutch Slip.
