## Throttle Body Model

## Introduction

The throttle body model is a key component to unlocking the advanced tuning features of the Emtron ECU. That is Throttle Mass Flow & Torque Modeling & Management. The accuracy of your setup in the throttle body mode is critical for good results.

Once the throttle mass flow feature is characterized and enabled, the throttle body model setup can be accessed and setup

The Throttle Body setup consists of 2 main parts:

* Throttle body diameter and scaler. 
* Throttle body area table.
