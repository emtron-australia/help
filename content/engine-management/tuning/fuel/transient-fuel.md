## Transient Fuel

![Image](</img/Z Axis30.jpg>)

Tuning transient functions in Emtune is done through a combination of function setup and table settings. 

 The following runtimes are generated which are applied/added/subtracted to final Injection PW.  

Accel Fuel                    – Added fuel PW (added to final injection PW)

Accel Clamp                    – The maximum PW that can be added at that moment

Decel Fuel                     – Decreased fuel PW (subtracted from final injection PW)

Decel Clamp                     – The maximum PW that can be decreased at that moment 

Fuel Acce/Decel Scaler     – The amount of PW governed by Engine Temperature Comp multiplier
