## Lambda Target Tables

![Image](</img/AAAA90.jpg>)

The Lambda Target Tables enable the user to define the Lambda target through the operation of the engine.

This needs to be determined before the VE table is manipulated.

Normally Lambda Target Table 1 is used. Setting of table use is via [Fuel Table Control](<fuel-table-control.md>)
