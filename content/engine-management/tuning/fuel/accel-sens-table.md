The Accel Sensitivity Table is the multiplication factor as a percentage of fuel added, based on the rate of change of the Accel/Decel mode 

Note: Must be set to PP or TP

Example:

dTP1 = 20%/sec

Accel Sense = 10%

Fuel base pulse width = 5.0ms

Accel PW = 20 * 0.10 = 2.0ms

Total fuel pulse width = 5.0ms + 2.0ms = 7ms
