Lambda Table 1 is a primary setting in the ECU's airflow & fuel model.

The values entered here need to be determined before manipulating the VE table

The values are displayed in Lambda by default as Lambda is a valid reference for all fuel types including blends.

Should an actual Air Fuel Ratio be required to be displayed, this can be achieved by right mouse click on table

Available at the bottom of the list

Once activated, if the fuel model is set to a single fuel type, the Lambda Table 1 will be displayed in regular AFR units.

This feature will not work with flex or dual fuel models - see [Stoich Ratio Setup](<stoich-ratio-setup.md>)
