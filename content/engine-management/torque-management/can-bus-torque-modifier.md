## CAN Bus Torque Modifier

![Image](</img/Torque man 7.jpg>) 

This table is used to modify the torque calculation to be delivered as an output for use on an OEM Can Bus or other CAN bus applications. The Torque value can be "bent" allowing the user to change the behavior of a vehicle system e.g  Traction or Gearshift . This gets applied as an offset to both the Engine Torque and Driver Demand Torque. Table range is +/- 500Nm.

The default table is a single cell without axis. However, both the X & Y axis are available and can be enabled at any time in the axis setup form.
