Emtron can be configured to receive Custom Messages over CAN bus channels. 

To Receive the Custom RX Data sets, select them under 

Config -> Communications -> CAN Bus 1/2 -> DATA Set

** Scaling per data set will be fixed.  IE - CAN Speed for Data Set 1 must all be the same

** Channels received are raw CAN runtimes.  These channels must be assigned to "real" runtimes to be used in different sections of the ECU.
