## Min/Max Deviation From Initial Position Table

Allows the user to set the minimum and maximum deviation that can be used by the closed loop system.  

These parameters can be expanded into a 3D look up tables to provide greater accuracy regarding closed loop control.  

** These values are Duty Cycle when using a solenoid, Step counts if using a stepper motor, or Position if using DBW.
