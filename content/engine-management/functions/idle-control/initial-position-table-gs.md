## Initial Position Table (g/s)

This is a feed forward table for air flow in g/s for the electronic throttle positioning. 

Units = Throttle Mass Flow g/s

Above example shows the table spanned in 3D using Engine Temperature and Idle target RPM as the axis.

     **Tuning Tip**: As a feed forward table, this is the expected airflow in g/s for the engine at a given idle rpm & temperature.

                                 The actual airflow consumed by the engine is found in the Air Mass Final – Flow g/s runtime.

                                 Use this runtime to help 1Nsigh7set the values in this table.

                                 The more accurate this table is, the better the closed loop idle control will function

                                 See the example given below

  The above example shows a typical R35 Nissan GTR Initial Position table g/s and how this correlates to the Air Mass Final value
