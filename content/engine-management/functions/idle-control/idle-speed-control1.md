## Idle Speed Control

The following calculated run times are generated by Emtron that are Ide Speed Control related (to be further discussed more specifically): 

    Idle Target         –     Current Target Idle Speed

    Idle Position        -    Current Live Idle Position

    Idle Target Error         -     Error from Target Idle Speed 

    Idle Position Base     -     Base Position of Idle Speed (%/Steps)

    Idle Position Flow Target    -     Flow Target when using Idle TMF mode (g/second)

    Throttle Area - Idle     –     Idle Throttle Area %  

    Pedal Position 1        –     Pedal Position 

    Idle Target Offsets (grp)    –     Offsets to Idle Target (RPM)

    Idle Comps (group)     –     Offsets to Idle Position (%/Steps)

    Idle Status         –     Current status of Idle Speed Control

    Idle PID Status        -    Status of Idle Speed Control Closed Loop PID 

    Idle P, I, and D        -    Proportional, Integral, and Derivative live data from Closed Loop 

    Idle Feed Forward    -    Feed forward position for Idle Speed Closed Loop Control 

## Idle Speed Control Function Setup

Emtron has eight methods of Idle Speed Control

* Config, Function Setup, Idle Speed Control

2 Wire Idle Solenoid

    Configure one output for control

3 Wire Idle Solenoid

    Configure two outputs for control (Main/Slave)

Bipolar Stepper 

    Configure four outputs for control

Unipolar Stepper

    Configure four outputs for control

DBW 1

    No outputs, as the function takes over DBW positioning (raw position)

DBW 1+2

    No outputs, as the function takes over DBW 1+2 positioning (raw position)

DBW 1 TMF

    No outputs, as the function takes over DBW positioning (Throttle Mass Flow target)

DBW 1+2 TMF

    No outputs, as the function takes over DBW 1+2 positioning (Throttle Mass Flow target)

** Idle Throttle Mass Flow (TMF) Setup

Use the "Tuning View -> Engine Functions -> Throttle Body Model" menu to config the Throttle Mass Flow settings.  As TMF uses the pressure before and after the throttle plate, these pressure references in this menu must be setup correctly.  See Idle Speed Tuning
