## Integral Gain Table

Integral gain controls how much adaptive correction is needed.

This parameter can be expanded into a 3D look up table to provide greater accuracy regarding closed loop control.  

I is Gain * 0.01 *Idle Target Error to convert to g/s added – counts/increments with the control frequency
