Oil Pressure              -  Engine Oil Pressure Sensor (If Fitted)

Fuel Pressure           -  Fuel Pressure Sensor (If Fitted) - *Fuel Pressure 1 Differential Offset runtime is utilised*

EGT                           -  EGT Sensors (If Fitted)

Each function must be enabled and cut type selected to become active.

(Fuel or Ignition Cut) - Fuel Cut is recommended

Once active, each function must be defined for correct operation.

Further engine protection can be defined by the user through the use of user functions and or timers.
