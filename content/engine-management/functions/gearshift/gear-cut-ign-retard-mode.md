Gear Cut Ign Retard Mode

Applies the Ignition Retard as either an

Offset or Percentage of Current Ign Angle

Example: Current Ignition Angle = 20.0 BTDC

Offset = 15.0 Deg Retard.  

Ignition Angle during Gear Cut is

= 20.0 - 15.0 = 5.0 Deg  BTDC

Percentage = 50.0 % Retard. 

Ignition Angle During  Cut :

= 20 - 50% x 20.0 = 10.0 Deg BTDC

0: Offset

1: Percentage
