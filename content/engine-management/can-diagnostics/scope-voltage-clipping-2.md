Scope Voltage Clipping

The scope can only read +/- 25v.  Anything over 25v (regardless of input specifications) will display signals that can be misconstrued as error.

Above is an example of the scope “clipping” over its 25v limit. 

This is normal and should not be considered an error in signal.  

** If signals need to be measured reliably +/- 25v, then an external scope tool must be used.
