3.4 CAN Bus Wiring 

✍ CAN Bus High and Low are differential signals, so twisted pair **MUST** be used. Failing to do so will compromise the entire CAN Bus System. 

✍ 🖐◼ 🞟🞏🔾♏ ♏⌧⧫❒♏🔾♏ ♏◼❖♓❒🞏◼🔾♏◼⧫🞟📪 shielded twisted pair may be required to help with reliability and data integrity. 

✍ The less connectors in any transmission system the better. Unnecessary connectors are almost guaranteed to present an impedance discontinuity and hence may cause reflections and data loss. 

✍ CAN Bus termination must be done correctly by using a 120 ohm 0.25W resistor at each END of the bus system. 

✍ Maximum Stub length to a device from the main Bus is recommended at 0.3m, in accordance with High-Speed ISO 11898 Standard specification. See Figure 3.3. 

The ELC devices do **not** include an on-board CAN termination resistor, allowing the device to be wired at any position on the Bus. CAN Bus termination must be done correctly by using a 120 ohm 0.25W resistor at each end of the bus system as mentioned above. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show possible CAN Bus Implementation examples
