Emtron features a built in Scope for all ECU types.  Depending on the ECU (or if a plug in model – the type it is based off of), the number of channels that can be scoped is variable: 

SL4            -     Crank, Sync Sensor

SL6            -    Crank, Sync Sensor

SL8            -    Crank, Sync Sensor

KV8            -    Crank, Sync Sensor, DI 1-4

KV12            -    Crank, Sync Sensor, DI 1-8

KV16            -    Crank, Sync Sensor, DI 1-8

KV16M            -    Crank, Sync Sensor, DI 1-8

The scope function records the channels assigned to internal memory when started/stopped.  

The memory can be subsequently downloaded, erased, saved, and loaded by the other buttons in the scope tools. 

Scope use details are as follows:

Channel

User selectable channel visibility control.

Assignment

User defined channel assignment. 

Channels – Crank, Sync, and DI's depending on ECU model

Volts per Division

User defined volts per horizontal division per channel

Volts Offset

User defined trace offset for adjustable visibility control

Useful when determining trigger issues

Time Sec Per Div 

User adjustable vertical time scale per division.

Adjusted with up & down arrow keys

Time Sec Offset

Moves the trace to a specific position

Adjusted with left & right arrows key or drag position bar below scope trace with mouse

Sample Rate

User defined scope sampling rate.

The default value is 10ksps with 50ksps and 100ksps speeds available. 

Utilising the highest sampling speed is recommended particularly on a running engine 

** Note a higher sampling rate will use up the Emtron internal memory much faster.  A shorter period of recording should be anticipated (a few seconds generally).
