## Axis Feed Pressure Solenoids
### Active Axis/Clutch Behavior
Maintains about 3.5 bar above the active clutch pressure target.

### Inactive Axis/Clutch Behavior
Holds 10 bar at most times.
During fork movement, the inactive axis pressure is used to control the shift fork movement force and velocity. Once the fork is in position it returns to 10 bar.

---

## Lubricating Flow Solenoid
Remains active by default, allowing fully lubrication and cooling flow.
During a shift or high torque demand it will close off, to reduce pressure drop and allow maximum line pressure availability.
